    "eager to fit the data, we have omitted several important elements in\n",

    "1. look at statistical properties, including a discussion of mean values, variance and the so-called bias-variance tradeoff\n",

    "## Resampling methods\n",
    "Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern\n",
    "statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training\n",
    "set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to\n",
    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",
    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,\n",
    "1. The **bootstrap method**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. and **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition there are several other methods such as the Jackknife and the Blocking methods. We will discuss in particular\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap method.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they\n",
    "involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using\n",
    "different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent\n",
    "advances in computing power, the computational requirements of\n",
    "resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we\n",
    "discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools\n",
    "in the practical application of many statistical learning\n",
    "procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the\n",
    "test error associated with a given statistical learning method in\n",
    "order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level\n",
    "of flexibility. The process of evaluating a modelâ€™s performance is\n",
    "known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper\n",
    "level of flexibility for a model is known as model selection. The\n",
    "bootstrap is widely used.\n",

    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a nonparametric approach to statistical inference\n",
    "that substitutes computation for more traditional distributional\n",
    "assumptions and asymptotic results. Bootstrapping offers a number of\n",
    "advantages: \n",
    "1. The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difficult to derive, even asymptotically. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap to complex data-collection plans (such as stratified and clustered samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap background\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\widehat{\\theta} = \\widehat{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{X})$ is a function of random variables,\n",
    "$\\widehat{\\theta}$ itself must be a random variable. Thus it has\n",
    "a pdf, call this function $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$. The aim of the bootstrap is to\n",
    "estimate $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$ by the relative frequency of\n",
    "$\\widehat{\\theta}$. You can think of this as using a histogram\n",
    "in the place of $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$. If the relative frequency closely\n",
    "resembles $p(\\vec{t})$, then using numerics, it is straight forward to\n",
    "estimate all the interesting parameters of $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$ using point\n",
    "estimators.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: More Bootstrap background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that $\\widehat{\\theta}$ has\n",
    "more than one component, and the components are independent, we use the\n",
    "same estimator on each component separately.  If the probability\n",
    "density function of $X_i$, $p(x)$, had been known, then it would have\n",
    "been straight forward to do this by: \n",
    "1. Drawing lots of numbers from $p(x)$, suppose we call one such set of numbers $(X_1^*, X_2^*, \\cdots, X_n^*)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then using these numbers, we could compute a replica of $\\widehat{\\theta}$ called $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "By repeated use of (1) and (2), many\n",
    "estimates of $\\widehat{\\theta}$ could have been obtained. The\n",
    "idea is to use the relative frequency of $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$\n",
    "(think of a histogram) as an estimate of $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap approach\n",
    "\n",
    "But\n",
    "unless there is enough information available about the process that\n",
    "generated $X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n$, $p(x)$ is in general\n",
    "unknown. Therefore, [Efron in 1979](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344552)  asked the\n",
    "question: What if we replace $p(x)$ by the relative frequency\n",
    "of the observation $X_i$; if we draw observations in accordance with\n",
    "the relative frequency of the observations, will we obtain the same\n",
    "result in some asymptotic sense? The answer is yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating the histogram for the relative\n",
    "frequency of the observation $X_i$, just draw the values\n",
    "$(X_1^*,X_2^*,\\cdots,X_n^*)$ with replacement from the vector\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{X}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent bootstrap works like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw with replacement $n$ numbers for the observed variables $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ containing the values which were drawn from $\\boldsymbol{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the vector $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ compute $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$ by evaluating $\\widehat \\theta$ under the observations $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat this process $k$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done, you can draw a histogram of the relative frequency\n",
    "of $\\widehat \\theta^*$. This is your estimate of the probability\n",
    "distribution $p(t)$. Using this probability distribution you can\n",
    "estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the\n",
    "histogram of the relative frequency of $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$. Instead\n",
    "you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For\n",
    "example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\\widehat\n",
    "\\theta$, apply the etsimator $\\widehat \\sigma^2$ to the values\n",
    "$\\widehat \\theta ^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code example for the Bootstrap method\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code starts with a Gaussian distribution with mean value\n",
    "$\\mu =100$ and variance $\\sigma=15$. We use this to generate the data\n",
    "used in the bootstrap analysis. The bootstrap analysis returns a data\n",
    "set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have\n",
    "data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each\n",
    "bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method\n",
    "shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian,\n",
    "centered around the mean value $\\mu=100$ but with standard deviation\n",
    "$\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in\n",
    "this case the same as the number of original data points). The value\n",
